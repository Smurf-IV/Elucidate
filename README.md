## FAQs

**Q**: What is SnapRAID?<br/>
**A**: SnapRAID is a software-defined snapshot-parity engine for Windows and Linux operating systems. On the most basic level, it offers protection to the contents of a file-system under its umbrella by computing the hashes of its component files and storing the results on a parity file. In the event of a complete hard drive failure, this parity file can be used to reconstruct the lost data. For full detail, visit SnapRAID's [official comparison of file protection engines.](http://snapraid.sourceforge.net/compare.html)

**Q**: Why a GUI, the Command Line works!<br/>
**A**: The larger goal is to create a feature-complete GUI with additional management features designed to aid a user in maintaining a functioning SnapRAID environment. Sometimes, ‘point and clicks’ are easier for a novice to get going with. SnapRAID's technical documentation and deep configurability can make adopting it off-putting to those looking to try it out!

**Q**: I'm still uncertain, is there more ?<br/>
**A**: Yes, Have a look at the [documentation](./docs/Documentation.md) for pictures etc.

**Q**: So what are the "Larger Goals" ?<br/>
**A**: See the __Roadmap__ below for a complete breakdown.
